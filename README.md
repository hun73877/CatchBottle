- <b>AAC-ViewModel</b> Combined with the screen, it maintains screen state and handles UI state and screen rotation events.
- <b>Coroutine</b> Asynchronous Task. Used 'Flow' to make data flow and reflect it in the UI. 
- Jetpack
  - <b>Hilt</b> Dependency Injection
  - <b>Room</b>
    - Focused on implementing functionality by leveraging SQLite wrapped in an abstraction layer, and combined 'Flow' to implement UI interaction more easily.
  - <b>Worker</b>
    - Easy background Asynchronous Task. This included one-time data patching or ongoing data processing.
  - <b>Compose</b>
    - UI work made easier than 'Views' in a declarative manner. Programming by referring to the [Unidirectional data flow document](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/architecture#udf).
    - Programming in ‘Custom UI Component’ units, based on my own 'Design System'.
    - ‘Custom UI component’ that emits events based on higher-order functions
    - Implement a UI testable screen by separating @Composable functions

  - <b>Navigation</b> is Navigate multiple screens with tab navigation
- <b>Glide</b> Image loading library
- <b>Firebase</b>
  - Use <b>RemoteConfig</b>, Implementing Banner Image Event
  - Banckend Storage Managning by <b>FireStorage</b>

I have already completed the ['DevFest 2021 Android Jetpack Compose'](https://github.com/winter-love-dev/ComposeFest2021) training course. Also, because I have experience developing declarative UI with iOS and Flutter, I was able to remember and learn this Compose study quickly and easily.
